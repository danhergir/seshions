# Agent View

**A lightweight terminal-based agent orchestrator for managing multiple AI coding assistants.**

Run multiple AI coding agents in parallel and manage them from a single dashboard. Agent View is a lightweight tmux session manager built for AI-assisted development workflows - monitor agent status in real-time, get notifications when agents finish or need input, and seamlessly switch between sessions.

Works with **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **OpenCode**, **Codex CLI**, and any custom AI coding tool.

## Why Agent View?

When working with AI coding agents, you often need to run multiple agents on different tasks - one refactoring a module, another writing tests, a third exploring a bug. Agent View lets you orchestrate all of them from one place instead of juggling terminal tabs. It's the missing multi-agent management layer for your AI-assisted development workflow.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Dashboard** - View all your AI coding assistant sessions at a glance with real-time status indicators
- **Smart Notifications** - Get notified when an agent finishes a task or needs your input, so you can context-switch efficiently
- **Session Management** - Create, stop, restart, and delete coding agent sessions with keyboard shortcuts
- **Git Worktree Integration** - Automatically create isolated git worktrees for each agent session, keeping your branches clean
- **Tool Agnostic** - Works as a Claude Code manager, Gemini CLI orchestrator, OpenCode dashboard, or with any custom AI tool
- **Keyboard-First** - Fully navigable terminal UI with keyboard shortcuts for maximum productivity
- **Session Groups** - Organize sessions into groups by project or workflow
- **Persistent State** - Sessions survive terminal restarts and system reboots via tmux

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
export AGENT_VIEW_REPO="your-org/agent-view"
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${AGENT_VIEW_REPO}/main/install.sh" | bash
```

### Manual Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-org/agent-view.git
cd agent-view
bun install
bun run build
```

### Compile Standalone Binary

```bash
bun run compile        # Current platform
bun run compile:all    # All platforms (macOS/Linux, x64/arm64)
```

## Usage

### Start Agent View

```bash
agent-view
# or use the short alias
av
```

### Compatibility Aliases (Deprecated)

`agent-orchestrator` and `ao` are still supported for one release to ease migration.
Use `agent-view` or `av` going forward.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Dashboard:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | Create new session |
| `Enter` | Attach to session / toggle group |
| `↑/k` | Navigate up |
| `↓/j` | Navigate down |
| `→/l` | Expand group (or attach to session) |
| `←/h` | Collapse group |
| `d` | Delete session or group |
| `r` | Restart session |
| `R` | Rename session or group |
| `f` | Fork session |
| `F` | Fork session with worktree |
| `g` | Create new group |
| `m` | Move session to group |
| `1-9` | Jump to group by number |
| `Ctrl+K` | Open command palette |
| `?` | Show help |
| `q` | Quit |

**Inside attached session:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+K` | Detach and open command palette |
| `Ctrl+T` | Open terminal pane |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Detach (return to dashboard) |

### Create a Session

1. Press `n` to open the new session dialog
2. Select your AI tool (Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, etc.)
3. Enter the project path
4. Optionally enable git worktree for an isolated branch
5. Press `Enter` to create and attach

### Configuration

Create `~/.agent-view/config.json` to customize defaults:

```json
{
  "defaultTool": "claude",
  "worktree": {
    "defaultBaseBranch": "main",
    "command": "git worktree"
  }
}
```

If you previously used `~/.agent-orchestrator`, Agent View will migrate compatible data
to `~/.agent-view` on startup.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) for session management
- At least one AI coding tool installed (claude, gemini, opencode, etc.)
